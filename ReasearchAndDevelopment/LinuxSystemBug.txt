There is a bug that is preventing me from using the console application
scheduleCollect on the linux server.

Differences
Linux             Windows
---------------------------------
Python 2.7.12     Python 2.7.10
schedule 0.4.2    schedule 0.3.2


Does schedule 0.3.2 work with python 2.7.12?


-- (Linux) Updating from schedule 0.3.2 to 0.4.2 doesn't make a difference
