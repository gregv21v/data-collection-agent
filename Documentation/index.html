    <h1>Tutorial</h1>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    Install the following packages with pip.
    <ul style="list-style: none">
      <li><i>pip install beautifulsoup4</i></li>
      <li><i>pip install schedule</i></li>
      <li><i>pip install pymongo</i></li>
    </ul><br>

    Each scrapper requires it's own library. They are as follows:
    <ul style="list-style: none">
      <li><i>pip install python-craigslist</i></li>
      <li><i>pip install meetup-api</i></li>
      <li><i>pip install yelp</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Running the console app</h2>
    In the linux terminal, type <i>python console.py</i>
    <h2>Example case of using the console with craigslist</h2>
    <p>
      When you enter the console, you will be prompted to choose
      a database. To see a list of available data sources, type 'options'
      or 'o'. This time without the quotes. These instructions will be
      restated within the application. Each data source has can be abbrivated
      to single letter, so if you type 'c', you get craigslist. Type 'c' now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have choosen your data source, you have a some commands available
      for that data source. In this cause, you are going to want to use the command
      <i>scheduleCollect</i>. The command <i>scheduleCollect</i> schedules the application
      to scrape between the hours of the start time, and end time. For example, </i>scheduleCollect "23:00" "23:30"</i> would
      start scrapping at 11am and end at 11:30am. Scrapping would occur at those times each day.
      The quotes must be included. Pay attention to the clock of the system you are using because it may very.
      The server time is different then the time on my computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side note: <i>sampleCollect</i>, and <i>sampleStore</i> will be quite useful when testing the collection
      of data. <i>sampleCollect</i> displays a sample of the data collected from the database, and
      <i>sampleStore</i> stores an example result to the default database.
    </p>
