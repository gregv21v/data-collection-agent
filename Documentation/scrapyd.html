    <h3>Using Scrapyd with this project</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>How do you add a job to the scrapyd server?</h3>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- List of commands -->
    <!--
      Add a spider to the project
      curl http://localhost:6800/schedule.json -d project=default -d spider=somespider

      Since windows does not directly allow you to use scrapyd-deploy from the getgo,
      you have to use the absolute path to it. C:\Python27\Scripts

    <h3>Installing Scrapy</h3>

    <p>
      You can install scrappy from <a href="http://scrapyd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>If you experience any errors, these instructions might help</h3>

      I had to additionally install a few packages to successfully install scrapyd on my system. The difficulties
      you have may be different depending on your system. If you do encounter the same errors, here is how I resolved
      them on my system.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, I had an error related to Visual Studios, and I resolved it by installing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266">this</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      libxml2 wasn't installed for me, so I had to install it. Here is a short post that will explain how. It's not
      directly available through pip.
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33785755/getting-could-not-find-function-xmlcheckversion-in-library-libxml2-is-libxml2">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might actually find out later down the line that you need the python win32api package. You can get that
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580855/where-to-find-the-win32api-module-for-python">here</a>.

      Then again, you might need to install pywin for the server to work with a spider properly. You can get the
      build <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20220/">here</a>.
